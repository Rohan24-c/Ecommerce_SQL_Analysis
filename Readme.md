# E-commerce SQL Data Analysis

This project is a simple SQL-based analysis of an e-commerce dataset using SQLite. It was part of a learning task to practice writing queries, creating views, using joins, and optimizing with indexes.

The goal was to extract meaningful insights from the data, like how much customers spent, which products sold the most, and who the top customers were.

## What I Did

Here’s a quick summary of the queries I wrote and the kind of insights they gave:

1. Total amount spent by each customer.
2. Orders with customer and product names.
3. Customers who spent more than the average order amount.
4. Total quantity sold and average price of each product.
5. Products with the highest sales by quantity.
6. Total amount spent per customer, grouped by name.
7. Basic customer contact info.
8. Orders where the total amount is greater than 500.
9. Top 5 customers based on total spending.
